# SocialNetworkAnalysisSurvey
EU LGBT survey dataset analyzed with Complex Network Theory techniques (**Italian language only**)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Abstract

The main idea stems from the curiosity of applying IT disciplines and tools to important and much discussed social issues.

Thus, the research carried out aims to investigate through Social Network Analysis the discrimination of the LGBT community within European countries.
The analysis was conducted on a dataset developed from the results obtained by the **European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA)** through the administration of the *"EU LGBT Survey"* questionnaire in 2012.

The main theme of this analysis deals with the prevalence of use in politics of offensive and discriminatory language against the LGBT population. The purpose is to highlight the **possible correlation** between the language of political figures and influencers and common thinking.

-***The obtained results confirm the data on the generic homophobia prevalence rate also in the Complex Network Theory domain.***

The secondary purpose of the analysis stems from my personal interest in wanting to shorten the distance between the *humanistic* and *scientific* defined disciplines. 
- Key question: *How is it possible and useful to leverage mathematical models in order to solve social or psychological issues?*.

### Introduction and methods
 
The survey was administered anonymously between April and July 2012, via the lgbtsurvey.eu website to a sample of 93,079 people belonging to the LGBT community. It investigates different aspects of their lives (fundamental rights). 

These aspects were placed into **four macro-categories** of questions: daily life, discrimination, violence and persecution, and rights awareness.
The major focus was put on one particular question in the " Daily Life" section, which analyzes two key aspects of our society: **politics** and **minorities**. 

This question was selected among others as it provides several insights for possible analysis in other social issues. As an example,  it is not uncommon that in countries with a high incidence of discrimination, the correlation with other, apparently unrelated, social issues (violence, censorship, illiteracy, etc.) is **high**.
